# STEPin_Seat_Temperature_Monitoring_System
The Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In European countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that his equipment should work efficiently in that whether. In our project, the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature.
